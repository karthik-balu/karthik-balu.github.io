I am a Software Validation Engineer in the Automotive Industry. My career path has two stops so far - my first was at Visteon Corporation for 1 year and 9 months. I worked in Jaguar and Land Rover Instrument Panel clusters there. I was exposed to Agile Philosophy here and contributed to the team achieving ASPICE L3 recognition and was rewarded with a Silver Award for Performance. My current pitsop is at Mercedes-Benz R&D India, where I'm here as a third-party consultant through Wafer Space Semiconductors. I work on ESP-LRG functionalities, focussing on Autonomous Driving in Specific Environments(ADSE). <br />
More on me - I am an Electronics Undergraduate at SRM Easwari Engineering College, with a passion for Programming. I'm inclined towards working with Embedded Systems, Internet of Things and Application Development. My programming skill-set includes C, C++, Python while my web-development tools include HTML,CSS and Bootstrap Framework. I've also worked with Github Version Control, have debugged with Valgrind and GDB.

In my free time, I am an avid reader, traveller/trekker, foodie and social volunteer. My dedication and discipline are my key qualities as is my persistence. I am a team player with proven experience in working as a team to tackle problems in various instances during my education/internships. I always strive to learn new things and keep progressing. I'm an optimist, greatly influenced by Ayn Rand's writing.
