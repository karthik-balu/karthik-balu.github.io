My career path has two pitstops so far - my first was at Visteon Corporation for 1 year and 9 months. I worked in Jaguar and Land Rover Instrument Panel clusters there.

More on me - I am an Electronics Undergraduate at SRM Easwari Engineering College, with a passion for Programming.

In my free time, I am an avid reader, traveller/trekker, foodie and social volunteer. My dedication and discipline are my key qualities as is my persistence. I am a team player with proven experience in working as a team to tackle problems in various instances during my education/internships. I always strive to learn new things and keep progressing. I'm an optimist, greatly influenced by Ayn Rand's writing.
