			Skydiving from a point through clouds is already an adrenalin-pumping adventure. Now, think about doing that over bubbling fire, sputtering liquid or thick smoke - in air thick with the smell of sulphur. Dropping and Flying over Active Volcanoes will be simply adrenalin-popping! Here are accounts of places where it has been done:
		</p>

		<li>Mount Fuji, Japan</li>

			</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			Mount Fuji on Honshu Island, Japan, a 3772 metre high active volcano, last erupted in 1707.Shin Ito and Jari Kuosma attempted a Fly-Over in 2013. They dropped in their wingsuits from 3810 metres and soared over the mountain, looking at the crater from atop, as gravity and wingsuit maneuvers kept them afloat long enough to deploy their chutes.

		<li>Mount Etna, Italy</li>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">
				<img src="/static/images/articles/a3/i4.jpg" class="image-center" />
				
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">
				<img src="/static/images/articles/a3/i5.jpg" class="image-center" />
				
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">
				<img src="/static/images/articles/a3/i6.jpg" class="image-center" />
			</div>
		</div>


		<p>
			The Sicilian Mountain Etna is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. At 3329m high, it is also the tallest in Europe. Felix Woelk and friends cycled Italy to jump from Etna and other active volcanoes in Italy including the one in picture - Mount Stromboli in December 2015. They went to Etna when it was at its volcanic high, stealthily of course - to one of the craters while it was spewing smoke and smog from hell and base jumped from craters. Nearly one hour after they landed far away Etna erupted in all its hellish fury.

		<li>Mount Bromo, Indonesia</li>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">

		</div>



		<p>
			Standing 2329m tall, Mount Bromo in Jakarta,Indonesia, last erupted in 2016. The Redbull Skydiving team of Waltenspiel, Lettner, Roithmer and Furst leapt out of a helicopter at 4000 metres above Mount Bromo, just when the winds and the weather permitted them to do it, in the early part of 2015. "You can't feel the heat," says Marco Waltenspiel "But you can smell the sulphur."  They soared over the mountain, before soaring out and parachuting back to level ground.

		<li>Villarrica , Chile</li>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">
				<img src="/static/images/articles/a3/i10.png" class="image-center" />

			<div class="col-md-4 col-12">

			Rising 2847m above sea level, Villarrica towers over the town of the same name in Chile. It is one of Chile’s most active volcanoes which last erupted in March 2015. During June 2016, Roberta Mancino and her team of three skydived from a helicopter and soared through the fiery fumes before landing on the magma soil along the slopes of Villarica.

		<p>
			Well, these fiery souls experienced flying over the flames and smoke and enjoyed the adrenalin and the sulphury air. We are looking to do it in the not so distant future… What about you?
