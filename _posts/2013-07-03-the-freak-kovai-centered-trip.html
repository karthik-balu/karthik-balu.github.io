		<i>29th June</i>: It was around 12pm. All bags were packed. There  was gonna be a journey. Only the destination was vague. This was just  the beginning! Siva called me up at 1pm and I told him I was dead bored  waiting for getting off. He laughed and told get your bags and come to  Koyambedu. I left home at 1.30pm and gave him a call to get off too. A  bus to CMBT followed. I arrived a tad bit early and started pacing  through the platforms. Perfect symptom of beginning of freak-dom. After  enquiries, phone calls, pacing, sitting and more pacing, this short guy  dressed all in black with a bag on his shoulders showed up. Yeah yeah,  that was Siva. We got into the bus that was off to Coimbatore. We set  off at around 4pm. Chats, memory recalls, breath-taking scenes, some  rain splattering and conductor-teasing! We dined at Salem bus-stand,  curd rice! Slept took over until the bus entered Coimbatore.

		<i>30th June</i>:  3 am. Coimbatore Bus Stand at 3 in the morning. I was all for going to a  cemetery for fun but Siva spotted a bus to Ooty. All our other  destinations had some incredible showers and it was not safe to trek  them right then. Siva had a ooty brain wave and the descend uphill on a  bus resulted. At 4-5 in the morning, you do NOT want to be hit by the  cold winds of ooty. Chilly! Goosebumps and hair-standing and a pleasant  change from all the heat! Ooty bus stand at around 6.45 I think. We had  taken a ticket to Pykaara falls. We reached the place around 7.30am.  Some snaps and a peek at the falls showed us that water wasn’t all  rushing. There weren’t many people there at that time. We had a photo  shoot and started to walk to Ooty, 22kms ahead. We hiked for 4 kms  before we stopped to eat snickers. Some langurs showed up on cue in the  trees overhead. Monkeys have an astoundingly awesome sense of smell. I  wish I hadn’t known that. Ignorance IS bliss! Unfortunately, I knew and  we started to double up ahead. A lorry came up and we asked for lift!  Ooty isn’t Chennai and lorry drivers stop at ooty! We got off at 9th  mile, a small hill and did a mini trek and got some photos and immersed  ourselves at the beauty of the place.

		We started to walk again. This  time a tempo carrying jack fruit passed by and it stopped when we called  out too! Crazy moment when we hanged on to the handles, sitting at the  back! Hanging on for life? Hell, it was more like hanging on for fun! Wind whipped our faces and Siva messed up his dress with Jack fruit  sticky milk. The tempo stopped for sales and we sat on some stones for a  while. Then the next stop was Pine forest. Pines that looked centuries  old and reached the sky stood up! After thanking the tempo guys, we set  off downhill to the lake below. I learnt to walk on steep terrain  without slipping. We reached the lake where the tourists had messed it  up well: Pollution from plastic dumping. It stank like million skunks. A  herd of buffalos looked comfortable nearby and some Horse-riders stood  nearby. We went up and were greeted by a Monkey crowd; we walked a  little before we spotted another lorry. We went in the lorry to the  nearest bus stand. A bus to Ooty followed. From there, we took another  bus to Emerald Lake. Some hair pine swerves and wonderfully crafted tea  plantations encompassed the journey. We hiked to the Emerald Lake Dam, a  km or 2 uphill. After obtaining permission from the police guard, we  enjoyed the breeze on the dam. Still waters which were unpolluted to  some extent looked up to us. No photography allowed in that place,  though we did manage some sneaky snaps. Then we hiked on to Avalanchi  dam, some 2kms away. The guard was nice and we sneaked some photos  again. We lunched outside the dam and proceeded down. Siva had some  cricket fun with the locals while I stood watching the play. We took the  bus back to Ooty.

		From Ooty We took another bus to near Wellington. We  had this plan to trek down the railway track. A short trek on the  railway bridge from Wellington to Conoor proceeded with photos, exotic  views and satisfaction! We got into a bus at Conoor to Coimbatore. There  weren’t any seats, so I had a dizzying roller coaster ride with all the  curves, sudden stops and nausea. We got seated at metupalayam when some  people got down. We reached Coimbatore after a nice sleep. We got into a  hotel below where we charged Siva’s phone after asking the shopkeeper  and we had tea and snacks for 45 mins! We decided to kill time by  watching some movie. We walked for 2.5kms to Brooke fields mall but  there weren’t any shows and so, we ended up sitting near some plug  points where we discussed plans for the next day and charged up our  phones. It was around 9.15 or something. We took a bus back to the  Coimbatore bus stand where we had planned to stay for the night. We ate  at a nearby shop watching Rohit and Raina play on the TV. By some  misfortune, we went to sit at some chairs in the bus stand where a  police officer showed up and shooed us. Totally pissed off, I suggested  we spend the night at the railway station! We got a bus to the station  and got in. We started sleeping off at the station before some cops came  back in and started lathi hitting some other fellow sleepers. It was  11.45pm. I woke up Siva and we went out. We got a bus and got off in  some other bus stop. Siva got off because well, he was totally  sleep-deprived frenzy! We took to a hotel and paid up and spent the  night sleeping like logs.

		<i>1st July</i>: 5.20 am. That  was when Siva woke me up. The alarms we had set at 4 am had long since  gone out. We got ready hurriedly and packed up, gave the keys back and  went out to get a bus to Ukkadam. From there,  we got into a bus to Palani. After a lengthy bus journey, we got off  and got in again, this time into a bus for Pamppambatty. We had this  idea to trek up Guthurai-aaru. From pappambatty , this destination was  8kms away. We waited for long and then got into a lorry which dropped us  at Mayilaadupaarai. We started walking and we had covered 3kms. We had 3  more kms ahead when a lady stopped us and asked us to wait since bus  would be there soon. She gave us a bad review of the place that we  started walking back. Bus passed by. We met two other people who told us  that the place wasn’t safe and theft by bullying was common. We walked  back to bus stand where we caught the returning bus and went to  Udumalai. From Udumalai we got into another bus to Thirumoorthy dam  because We wanted to accomplish something in Palani.

		We went there and  did a trek up the Thirumoorthy malai. Inadvertently I opened up a  snickers pack and started munching. I forgot all about monkeys and one  little pesky creature looked up from ahead. We ran past the rascal after  some comedies. We reached the stream, rested our feet, returned  running! We paid a visit to the temple nearby and then got into the bus  back to Udumalai and then from there another bus to Coimbatore. We  munched on snickers, Monaco biscuits, listened to songs, saw the  landscape running by till we fell asleep. We finally reached ukkadam and  got into another bus to Gandhinagar bus stop where we roamed past a  textile shop for half an hour, talking crap and killing time, waiting to  meet up with a friend of ours. After the meeting and eating some corn  and ice cream and drinking cold chocolate, we went to the railway  station where we got the tickets to home. We waited for the train to  come and we had to wait in a line to get into the unreserved general  compartment of the train! Looks like things are different in Coimbatore.  We luckily got a window seat and we left Coimbatore at 8.50pm.

	<p><i>2nd July</i>:  4.45am.All crunched in a corner where 6 people occupied a side and  still managing to sleep we reached Chennai in around 8 hours. Siva got  off at Perambur and I reached Central at 5.15am and reached home and  traffic and “civilization” at 8 with memories,grinning from teeth to teeth at the crazy moments.
