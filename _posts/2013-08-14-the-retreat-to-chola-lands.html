When you expect for a thing to happen for a long time, you feel  really really elated when it finally happens. The trip to The Living  Chola Temples was something like that. Siva and I set forward on this  trip, Arunachalan having dropped out unexpectedly. After a long day at  the college, I hurried home on 10th August. It was around 6.15pm when I  set out, all bags packed! I was so damn eager to see any place other  than the bare walls of my college! I reached CMBT around 7.30pm and saw  Siva standing there near the bus we intended to board. The destination:  Tanjore. An 8 hour journey ensued - with funny recaps, story-exchanges,  college abuse, experiences, songs and sleep. I remember getting up at  Kumbakonam at around 3.15am the next day and I finally stepped onto  Tanjore at around 4.45am.

After some thinking, planning and enquiry, we  made our way to the pride of Tanjore: the Big Brihadeeshwara temple.  Even from the bus-stand, the temple’s gopura-tip gleamed high. After  some pondering, wandering and snaps, we stepped into the temple at  5.40am. The sculpture-gazing started at once! Wonderfully chiselled  structures stood out beautifully. The huge Nandi and the Lingam in the  inner sanctum were awe-inspiring too. To think that all these were built  several thousand years ago is totally breath-taking. After the  beauty-worship( and yeah, the snaps ;-) ) we set out from the temple at  around 7.15am. We went to Thanjaipureeshwarar temple after which the  town is said to be named. It has inscriptions implying kubera worship.  Then we went on to 3 temples nearby that belong to the 108 divya-desams.  We took a call whether to proceed to the palace that opened at 9am or  go on to kumbakonam and decided to do the latter. It was around 8.20am.  An hour’s journey to Dhaarasuram followed. We visited the popular  Irawatheswar temple, another UNESCO heritage site.</p>

A look at the  inscriptions, snaps and some pigeon sighting followed. We proceeded to  Udayalur at around 9.30, to pay homage to the greatest Chola king –  Rajaraja I. After a tea and a wee bit of waiting, a hitch-hike happened!  Wind whipping your face always brings you a wide, satisfied smile! We  got into an auto to Udayalur, which incidentally is near Pazhayarai- an  old Chola capital, from the drop-point mid-way. A shock awaited us. I  expected a grand tomb but all I got to see was a thatched roof with a  lingam marking the burial site.

Apparently,  we who build grand tombs and statues for politicians of our times don’t  care to give statues to a king who gave us monuments to look at. I felt  a little abashed at that point. We met the priest taking care of the  site, who was clearly over 60. After getting info that politicians also  had visited this place, I WAS abashed. We went on to Pateeshwaram where  we roamed the temple there, still engrossed in thoughts. The huge temple  there has two entrances and we had to look out for a while to get to  the right entrance so that we could get back to our slippers. :p We got  into a bus to Kumbakonam which was some 15kms away. We got down near  Adhikumbeshwar Temple at around 11.15am. We went on to visit  Sakkarapaani temple and Saarangapaani temple all of which had awesome  sculptures, signs stating cameras were banned and WOW shrines in their  main sanctums. After sugarcane juice, we did some after bus-chase there.  We then went to Mahamaham tank, a few minutes away, and sat down for a  while before getting over to the bus stand- a long walk! It was nearing  1.45pm. We did a judgement call again whether to proceed to  Gangaikondacholapuram or return home. After a coin-toss and considering  the 6 and half hour journey and Arunachalan’s absence, we decided to get  back to Chennai. A bus-ride with songs, and planning for more trips  followed. The trip ended when I and Siva went our separate ways at  Perungalathur stop, at nearly 8.30pm. It was Sunday night and I reached  home at 9pm. College next day was not enough for me to stop thinking of  the relics left behind by the Chola rulers. I slept with a smile :)</p></div>
