<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Meesapulimala – the highest peak outside Himalayan range that can be  climbed with permission from forest department – had eluded me and my  friends long enough. Two to three trips to the locality earlier had  ended up without summiting Meesapulimala. This time, my friends and I  were determined.<br /> Siva and Rohit decided to go on a  heritage trip to Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi. On that day, Sid and I were  writing our end-semester final exam. After finishing off the exam fast,  I waited a wee bit for a bus to take me to CMBT. When I finally got  there, Sid was waiting there for some 40 minutes. &nbsp;I entered the bus  depot and got two bottles of Amma water cans. It was 2.15pm on 13/6/14/.  After I came, we asked around and immediately decided to take a Madurai  bus. It was around 2.20pm when we got into a Nagercoil bus that went  via Madurai. The bus took off at 2.40pm and I was grinning all over with  a sense of adventure that was to come.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Pre-trek packing :D" class="photo_img img" height="240" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10370992_841998195827893_2574190412870810879_n.jpg?oh=3b5f94faed356c5f7ec3a6d86fddbcaa&amp;oe=5469F8D4&amp;__gda__=1416808498_3660103234d9cb4a262f3b4c3f4f11f8" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Pre-trek packing :D" width="320" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="photo " style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span class="caption">Pre-trek packing :D</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /> We  chatted, Sid and I, me generally trashing my college. A nice round of  12 chappathis and 12 idlies in between was our lunch and dinner (4pm and  8.30 pm) ^_^. We got down at Madurai Maatudhavani bus stop at 12 o  clock midnight. We got into a local bus to Aarapalayam stop which we  reached by 12.20am. We got into a Cumbum bus that would take us to Theni  at 2am. In between we had a series of calls from Siva and Rohit who  were waiting at Theni bus stop. They boarded a bus to Munaar that took  off early. &nbsp;We got to Theni at 2.16am and got into a KSRTC bus to  Munaar. Some light trolling went on between me and Sid, on a man wearing  a sweater. Sid sure had to eat his words when the bus got near Munaar  and the cold morning winds started to hit our bones. It was around 5.30  am when we got down at Munaar. Siva gave us some directions that I  couldn’t follow and finally as we were following the bus we saw this guy  in grey hoody- a bit short - and clutching to a phone. Instant  recognition – Siva! :D We laughed at each other and went off to a nearby  bus stop and got ready for the walk to Kerala Forest Development Office  which was at a flower garden a kilometre away. We made it there in less  than an hour with laughter and trolling and fun. We got to KDFC office  and found it locked. We took out cams and started waiting – for more  than 30 minutes before we got Siva to call KDFC District Manager. The  gates opened 5 minutes later. Siva went ahead to get the permits which  cost us 500 each, while Rohit, Sid and I took out cams and asked if we  could look around.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="KDFC Garden - Flower Snaps ^^" class="photo_img img" src="https://scontent-a-sin.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t1.0-9/s180x540/10454452_841999099161136_1686486038169552432_n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="KDFC Garden - Flower Snaps ^^" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="photo photo_left" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span class="caption">KDFC Garden - Flower Snaps ^^</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="photo photo_left" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="LVOS Gang ;)" class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s180x540/10409381_842003832493996_3364362763929708709_n.jpg?oh=8b703fe27d085f3c83f6f32d0d810213&amp;oe=547BC77C&amp;__gda__=1416664354_0dcf30e487ad016351e4a8163a115b5f" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="LVOS Gang ;)" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="photo photo_center" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><span class="caption">LVOS Gang ;)</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>Our  guide,Muthu, came an hour or so later. After introductions,we discussed  our plans with him. And an hour later, the jeep arrived. Rohit and I  thought we’ll stay in the back rows and after an hour’s ride in high  speeds and dizzying heads, we reached a canteen inside the estate where  the base was located. We ate our breakfast there and I got a lemon for  safety’s sake. We then got to the maximum possible point till which the  jeep could go to. After that, it was hike/trek time! We decided to load  one bag and keep rest in the jeep. We got 6 water bottles, 20 snickers  and glucose and our first aid kit inside the big bag and decided to  carry it in turns. We started the climb. It was 10.10 am on 14/6/2014.  We reached Rhodo valley very soon, treated in the way to nice views of a  stream flowing by, some colourful mushrooms, the rare Rhododhendron,  elephant dung and pesky leeches. From the Rhodo valley, our destination  loomed in sight ominously. As we proceeded, the landscape kept changing,  from grasslands, to confers and pines and eucalyptus trees, making me  wonder aloud if this was some kind of crazy endurance mission :D We got  to the final stretch. It loomed up, 70 degrees ahead. It was 12 in the  afternoon.<br /> We made a dash to the peak, eager to see  it, to set foot on it to satisfy many failed attempts/nonattempts :P .  After all, delay is a disappointment, not defeat! We took only  snickers,threw our bag nearby and got ready to summit. Siva and Rohit  rushed ahead while Sid and I took our time. I ran for a while before  sitting down. Well, running at 2620 metres above sea level leaves you  famished! I then crawled my way, ran on fours and then on my two feet  and set foot finally on Meesapulimala, 2647 metres/8685 feet, the  highest peak outside Himalayas that can be scaled. The peak marked the  boundary between TN and kerala and a lone flower stood at the center of  the peak. It was around 12.10 pm when we summited.<br /><span class="photo photo_center" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"></span><br />We got to some photography, snickers eating , taking in the view etc., In 20 minutes we got ready for the climb down.<br /><span class="photo photo_right" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="In the cloud of darkness, there's a ray of sunshine :) Lone flower at the summit" class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t1.0-9/s180x540/10359331_842003702494009_6884483112855964975_n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="In the cloud of darkness, there's a ray of sunshine :) Lone flower at the summit" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="photo photo_right"><span class="caption">In the cloud of darkness, there's a ray of sunshine :) Lone flower at the summit</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table>We  did it with rejuvenated energy and got ourselves to leeches again.  After taking those pesky leeches off, we got down in haste, with our  guide taking us through some shortcuts that we loved and would’ve taken.  We finally reached the jeep at 2 pm, making the total time taken to  summit and get back – 4 hours, which was reported one of the fastest  times ever. Our smiles vanished a bit when Siva opened his shoe to see  lot of blood, thanks to a leech getting him in his veins. We quickly  cleaned the spot and bandaged it before getting into the jeep. &nbsp;We  cancelled our trip to Kodai to go to Rat-tail falls as our guide  mentioned that the water above would be too high. We didn’t wish to run  the risk of flash floods.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Leeech" class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/p180x540/10384908_842003495827363_2981876632099001695_n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Leeech" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Leech -__- :D</td></tr></tbody></table><br /> We  reached top Station from the estate soon enough. We did a slow  climb-down and reached Central station by 5, me and Rohit chatting along  nicely while Siva and Sid did comic photo shoots :P :P At Central, the  crazy me wanted to catch the bus and started running. Siva and Sid and  Rohit tried to stop me, in vain and they began to keep up. I slowed at  times and ran like crazy. Both times ive trekked down to kurangini,  we’ve made it on time only by running! I got there at 5.40 and the  others weren’t far behind. Thirstily we got some drinks at the local  shop, chatted with some locals there before boarding the bus to  theni-old bus stand. I was super zombified during the trip, sleeping  completely dreamlessly. We got to Theni old bus stand then made it to  the new bus stand in another bus from where we got on to a Madurai bus.  When we got down at Madurai, I was staring like crazy at others, who  stared back at me in the same way! Aliens of a kind. Siva took us to the  nearby jiggirthanda shop and was frustrated when we stared at him  waiting for one of us to order :D and we downed some tasty jiggirthanda.  We got to Maatudhavani and boarded a bus to Chennai-backseats – at  10.30pm. I slept on! At Tambaram,(7 and half hours later) Sid and I got  down bidding goodbye to Siva and Rohit and we grinned at each other  sheepishly drenched in the memories of jumps above clouds, the  conifers,leeches and grass-stretches of the elusive Meesapulimala, that  had eluded us for too long.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="In the hearts of the hills, the howling winds shall tell my tale of heartbreak,anguish, breakdown,recovery, regrowth and victory......." class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/10484110_842004292493950_1812342059073432417_n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="In the hearts of the hills, the howling winds shall tell my tale of heartbreak,anguish, breakdown,recovery, regrowth and victory......." /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span class="photo "><span class="caption">In  the hearts of the hills, the howling winds shall tell my tale of  heartbreak,anguish, breakdown,recovery, regrowth and victory.......</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="photo "><span class="caption"></span></span></div>
