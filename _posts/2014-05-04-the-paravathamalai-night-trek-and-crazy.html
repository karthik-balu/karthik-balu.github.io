		This trip was going to be a special one for many reasons. I had  wanted to go to parvathamalai many times and had even went to the bus  stop to go there – twice, only to have various circumstances stop me.  This was also my good friend Siva’s 25th outing. So, all bags packed, I  set out to CMBT to board a bus to Polur on the 27th of April, 2014,  Sunday. At CMBT, I met up with Siva’s cousin, Kailash, who was coming  with us. This 11th grader can sure talk a lot, as I was about to find  out! Siva was going to join us at the Polur bus stop from the Kavalur  observatory. We got into the 12.45 bus to Polur. The bus journey was  sleepy and I soon lived up to my er.. reputation by falling into deep  sleep! We reached Polur by 5pm. We called Siva, who said he’ll be there  by 2 hours and asked us to roam about. Well, killing time is something I  am good at.. We walked for a kilometre to a small hill called Venkata  Perumal Malai, which took as some 30 minutes. But at the base, the watch  and some huge dogs barking changed our minds. The locals also said that  climbing up and down would take close to two hours.

		So,  giving that up we slowly trudged back to the Polur bus stop. We downed  some juices and went and filled ourselves up at the Muniyandi Vilas  Outlet there. Siva and Deepak arrived later at nearly 8.15pm. After they  came, more juices followed and we then got into a bus to Kadalaadi –  the base of Parvathamalai at 9 pm. The four of us reached the base at  nearly 9.55pm where some friendly dogs joined our group. We started  climbing fast. The climb was tough as the slope rose steeply and the  weather was humid. In 10 minutes, the altitude rose by 100mts and we  were sweating like mad. If we were to squeeze our shirts then, a cup of  sweat would’ve been filled! I was sweeping behind this time too, as Siva  didn’t want the dogs that were walking close by me, too close to him :D  :D . After some breaks and continuous climbing we reached the area  where some poles were driven into steep rock. The slope rose at 80° at  that region. By the light of our torches, We could see how the path fell  to steep slopes on both sides. Siva asked me to the front at this point  and I had fun going ahead! We reached the temple at the top at 1am on  Monday. After seeing around the temple, we decided to sleep near a tower  in the temple where the winds were nice and heavenly.

		We  only had two blankets and we slept off sharing one blanket for two  persons. As the night progressed, the temperature dropped off badly and  winds rose up too. My teeth were chattering and I was shivering badly.  This was completely in contrast to the sweaty humid weather that was  prevalent during the climb. At around 3am, we shifted ourselves behind  the tower where the winds couldn’t come. Siva and I drifted asleep soon  and got up at around 5 am to see the sun rise.

		After  some photos and seeing the heavenly clouds underneath, we saw two  monkeys roaming in that region. One of the monkeys was particularly  aggressive. We had seen enough of the sun and started down at around  5.55 am.

		After  a little climb downhill, we were aggressively engaged by the monkeys.  At one point the aggressive monkey I mentioned before got up ahead and  started jumping at us. Siva who was leading, went back in defence. I  threw a bottle and stick to scare the monkey, which did scare it a bit  and made it even more aggressive and went down quick. The three others  retreated up instead and were quickly surrounded by more than 10-15  monkeys. I told them to use their bags as defensive tools and hit the  monkeys if they had to. I didn’t know how Kailash understood that  because in the next instant he threw his bag at the monkey. I had just  got past the aggressive monkey and was seeing the bag on the ground  behind me in utter shock at what the hell was happening. I tried to grab  the bag but the monkey was quicker and held it and started to make  growls and jumps at me. At this point, I tried to divert monkeys’  attention by throwing a glucose box down but they took the glucose and  looked at my bag intently now. I was surrounded by some 13 monkeys now,  all looking at my bag expectantly. I closed up my bag and ran downhill  to a shopkeeper there. I kept my bag in the shopkeeper’s tent and got a  thick stick from her and run uphill, barefoot all this time. All pent-up  frustration and rage got out at that instant. I roared aggressively and  charged at the monkeys which got shocked and scattered. The aggressive  monkey still stood by the bag and I shouted at its face and got close  with the stick and it also ran up. The good news- I got the bag. The bad  news- the monkeys went up to my three friends. I gathered up the bags  contents quickly which were thrown on the ground by the monkeys who were  clever enough to open the bag, mind you. In that instant, a towel and a  bottle at the edge of the path disappeared into monkey hands. I egged  my friends to charge and escape down, which they did somehow. We went to  the shopkeeper’s shop and drank some tea. All this action had taken  place along the thin path where the slope fell steeply downwards. I was  still in a rage and vented it on some monkeys that came down again. I  returned the stick and pulled out a root from the ground for myself. We  proceeded downhill fast and had monkey encounters between shops. I had  some really nice “khool” at a shop. We soon descended fast and met our  doggy friend soon.

		We now took photos and came down leisurely, recollecting the crazy monkey encounter and my outburst! Kailash  got an earful and I ensured I reminded him of it through the remainder  of the trip :P :P We were laughing a lot at everyone's antics..:D We  reached the base at 8.55am. We  went to a field nearby where we and the dog ate biscuits and we took  photos. We got into a bus to Polur at around 10.45am and reached the bus  stand nearly an hour later.

		We had a huge breakfast at Hotel Everest,  near the Polur bus stand at 11.45am. We got into a bus to Chennai at 12  noon which started off 15 mins later. We reached Perungalathur.3 hours  and 30 minutes later where I bid adieu to my friends. I reached Tambaram  and as I was looking for a bus home, I couldn’t help laughing at the  thoughts of me going wild on the wild monkeys….
