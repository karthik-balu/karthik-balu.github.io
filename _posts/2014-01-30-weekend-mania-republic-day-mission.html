		It was 24th January 2014, 4.40 pm. I was waiting at CMBT for my good  friend Aruna and right on time he arrived in a Verna. We were going on a  trip to Nagala! But the thing was, neither of us knew what the plan  was. We got into Aruna’s car and drove up to Siva’s place. Our organiser  and great friend joined us with an all-intelligent holy aura about him.  We drove off to a waiting point where we were joined by 2 other cars  and we drove on past toll booths to Nagalapuram, a famous trek-site in  Andhara Pradesh. We were going to have a star party! Siva is a  genius/geek when it comes to astronomy. He is a member/co-founder of  Chennai Astronomy Club whose members where the people in the other two  cars. It was going to be a star party at the Nagala West peak’s base. A  star party, for the people wondering what that is, is a night where  astronomers set up their telescopes and gaze into the heavens  identifying constellations, rare sights, meteors, galaxies, clusters..oh  well you get the idea. A dog there came with us and I was pretty sure he was sweeping me ;) We reached  the first pool by 6.45 am after a lot of walking and talking.

	We  had a nice lie-in and some group photos (It was republic day then!!)  before parting ways with the rest of CAC at the first pool. We started  trekking and reached the second pool soon enough. It was a glorious  sight!

	I had a pedicure session with them fishes before we started uphill once  again. After that it was going to be a lot of exploration because we  didn’t have the trail to follow after second pool. We went past Cascade  falls and reached the third pool soon enough and we were awestruck.

	The  third pool has a depth of more than 50feet which is pretty deep and  Dangerous. It was going to be a one-time drop with our heavy bags if we  were not careful.

		So,  after seeing nature up close, we went on and past another pool and  reached a pretty awesome falling from d heavens falls...;) ! We  searched for the trail all around and ended up with dead ends. We  didn’t want to risk it and decided to have an awesome time instead. We  shot our Republic day mission photo at the centre of Mini-kutraalam and  proceeded downhill.

		It was nearing 10 am. We went near Cascade falls and  where we had our breakfast while Siva had a dip. Then we went on to the  lovely, enchanting second pool where Aruna and I went for a swim. It  was Aruna and me swimming with the fishes, quite literally! After that  cold refreshing swim, we went on downwards looking up at the Nagala west  peak, towering at 850 metres above us, childishly playing peeka-boo  when we were just 200 metres short of it. We knew another weekend at  Nagala was gonna be up when we would reach the western peak! We got  downhill fast enough, met the doggy(We are naming him Aravindh, on the  request of one of our fellow travellers who has the same name J ) on its  way up with another group of trekkers, reached the car and started back  home. I reached home at 2pm in the afternoon. We didn’t summit yes, but  we did have hella lot of fun, which was our mission for the day ;)  Green rays from the 2nd pool kept reflecting in the back of my head as I  dozed off.
