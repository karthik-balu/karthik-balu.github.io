One fateful day(26th March 2013) Karthik Balu(me) woke up late as  usual. It was around 9.30 am to be precise. And I began my day with fb  browsing  I saw some  messages from Siva Subramanyam asking me to get to Egmore at 6.30pm. The  plan was to go to Srivilliputhur and Sathuragiri hills. After getting  ready for the trip, I made it from home  at 4.30pm after charging phone, taking water bottles etc., etc.,  I  reached the Egmore station at 5.30pm. I was standing at the ticket booth  taking the tickets when a guy in dark blue shirt tapped me and said hi.  Duh, That was Siva. It was nice seeing him after a long time and after  getting the tickets we chatted and planned and were charging his phone  at one of the charging booths. While standing there, incidents of  highlight include seeing a fat rat going into the sewers and a young  woman’s fall on the slippery ground. After 15 mins or so, our third  companion Arunachalam arrived! We got off well and after some enquiry,  reached the platform to find the stupid train already standing with the  people stationed inside the unreserved compartment already. We went to  the two unreserved compartment locations at the beginning and the end of  the train coach to no avail. There, we met two groups offering us  seats. One was a group of bad-boys and the other was a group of seat  brokers offering us seats for 50rs each even after us paying for the  seats already. A little mention of the fat broker regarding the seats  got Siva and Arunachalam to a place near the seats. There, we got up  into three vacant upper berth seats where we tossed and turned until we  were comfortable! We had a fourth guy from Sivakasi, who would later  treat us to samosas, for company. After an uneasy sleep and comfortable  chatting about colleges and movies and sitcoms, we made it to the fair  town – Srivilliputhur! It was about 7am when we made it there.  Srivilliputhur was scenic and inviting! We got into a share auto to the  main town and went first to the famous Andal Temple after some  refreshment.</p>

<p>The time was 8.20 am when we entered the temple and after  going round, seeing the deities and enjoying the awe-inspiring  architecture, we made it to the Vishnu temple, whose Gopuram forms the  official symbol of Tamil Nadu government! After seeing the deities there  and the garden inside the temple premises and meeting the  late-due-to-coffee acharaya, we took some pictures and left to have our  breakfast. After eating we left to a temple in which Lord Siva was the  presiding deity, in a share auto. After a quick look into the temple  (there was no power at that time!) we left to the Srivilliputhur  bus-stand and boarded a bus to Watrap. We went to Watrap and got into a  share-auto for Thaanipaarai, which was the base of Sathuragiri hills. We  commenced our climb at 10.20am, after a refreshing lemon sherbet and a  mango spiked with masala powder! Our path upwards was marked with a  visit to a little water fall, where we refreshed ourselves and numerous  calls for breaks from Arunachalam and myself. How Siva endured us, I  don’t know! We also stopped for suku-coffee in between and saw a water  spring with supposed medical qualities also. I also recall a sadhu  anointing my forehead with ash. We proceeded upwards also stopping at  two or three temples. All the people coming down told us that the  destination was “only” 45 minutes away! We finally reached the temple  top at 2.00 pm.(five hours of trekking!) There were two temples there, I  think. One of the temples has Lord Siva’s lingam in a crossed posture.

We immediately enquired for the Dhaavasi Paarai which was said to have a  sadhu meditating inside. It was supposed to be a cave where one can  only crawl in and was located few feet below the summit of the hill. We  set out on a thorny, stony (not rocky!) path. Stones hurt your feet more  than the flat surfaces of rocks! After reaching the top after an hour  or so, we crawled inside the rock after some persuasion from an old man  nearby.

<p>
We saw a sadhu in deep meditation. We wished not to disturb  anyone and so, after some quick snaps, we crawled back outside. We made  our way to a rock where temperatures were way below the current  temperature. The rock was called AC rock, and offered a bird’s eye view  of the town below! After some time there, we made our way to the temples  below in an alternate route. We were anxious because the mountains were  notorious for wild animals except lions and we made our way quickly and  silently. We saw bear marks on our way. We finally reached a place  where a huge Siva lingam had been crafted out of a single rock.

We met  some wayward youth there, who asked us for food and offered us drugs.  After a polite but firm “no”, we proceeded to the place where the  temples were there. I was anxious to proceed to the bottom now, because  of the encounter with the youth. The journey was marked with a single  stop which was at a spring where water dripped from a rock drop by drop.  We reached our destination and proceeded straight to the Anna Dhanaam  area. It was about 5.10pm. We had made it nearly to the summit and seen  everything that can possibly be seen and were back in almost 3 hours! I  ate to my heart’s content and after 30 minutes of rest and some  shopping, we set out to the bottom at 6.10pm. It grew dark very soon, in  nearly 30 minutes. After careful running wherever possible, tireless  walking, wading through an overflowing stream in total darkness, and  stopping for suku-coffee in between, we made it to the bottom-to  Thaanipaarai at around 8pm, in an hour and 40 minutes!! We got an auto  to Watrap where we stretched our legs and gazed at the receding  silhouette of the hills in wonder of all that had happened so fast, but  etched equally fast in our minds. We got a bus at Watrap to  Srivilliputhur, during which I was super-dazed and was in a semi-sleepy  state. It was around 9.15pm when we then got into a bus from  Srivilliputhur to Madurai. We made it to Madurai at 11.15pm and went to a  hotel and had parotas for dinner and jiggirthanda for refreshment! Mind  you, I was still in a dazed state! We boarded a bus from Madurai to  Chennai at nearly midnight. I had an easy time falling asleep and was  woken up by Siva near vandaloor. He asked me to get down at  Perungalathur which was nearer to my place at Tambaram, than the bus’  last stop at Koyambedu(CMBT). I waved my goodbye to Siva and Arunachalam  and made my way home in two buses. The End of the epic journey forever  etched in my memory.
