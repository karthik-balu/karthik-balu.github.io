<div class="article">
<p>
  This article is going to go over Return to Libc exploit. Whenever stdlib is included in a C file, a lot of functions are included as a by-product. One of the functions in stdlib/libc is system function.
   <br>This function takes one string argument and whatever argument is passed, it executes it. <br>
   </p>
   <pre class="prettyprint">
     <code>
     system("ls -l");
   </code>
   </pre>
   <p>
   Above code executes ls -l command as if from a shell. The idea of a Ret2libc attack is to reference the function address of system function and to pass /bin/sh as an argument to it.<br>
  Let's give it a shot now. SSH into narnia6 with password obtained from <b><a href="https://karthik-balu.github.io/projects/2018/10/15/Cybersecurity-Narnia5">here</a></b>.
</p>

  <ul class="list-unstyled bold-head">

    <li>Snap of /narnia/narnia6.c</li>
    <img src="/static/images/projects/p15/i3.png" class="image-center image-biggest" />
    <li>What is the vulnerability?</li>
    <p>
      Strcpy of b1 and b2 to commandline arguments is done.
      Function pointer to puts() function is assigned and this passes b1 to it.
    </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        strcpy(b1,argv[1]);
        strcpy(b2,argv[2]);
        fp(b1);
      </code>
      </pre>
    <li>Exploitation Steps:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Idea is to put address of "system" function in b1. Why? Because puts() prints b1 and could be tricked into calling system() function.
        Enter gdb ./narnia6 from /narnia folder. Run it. Find the address of system with <b>(gdb)print system</b>.
      </li>
      Snap: <br>
      <img src="/static/images/projects/p15/i2.png" class="image-center image-biggest" />

      <li>Now pass this as argument to file after 8 bytes of "A"s. Where to put the "/bin/sh" to this function is the next question. Function's store their arguments generally at %ebp+8,%ebp+12 and so on(Formula is <b>%(ebp +8 +4*(N-1))</b>). So We need to store "/bin/sh" 8 bytes from function call. We have 8 bytes of b2 in between after which we could give "/bin/sh"</li>
      <li>Now construct the payload and run the program.</li>

      <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        /narnia/narnia6 "$(python -c "print 'A'*8 + '\x50\xc8\xe4\xff')" "$(python -c "print 'A'*8 + '/bin/sh')"
      </code>
      </pre>

      <li>The shell prompt is displayed and you can cat the password for the next level.</li>

      Snap:<br>
      <img src="/static/images/projects/p15/i1.png" class="image-center image-biggest" />

    </ol>

    <p>
      <li>Behind the scenes explanation:</li>
      Environmental variables are cleared and argv[] values greater than argv[2] i.e 3 and above are also cleared.<br>
      This leads to use Ret2Libc using the 2 buffers cleverly.<br>
       We use the fact a function looks for its arguments at specified locations from the function call address to our advantage.<br>
      We also call system at the appropriate place with respect to this, thus gaining access to the shell.<br>
    </p>

    </ul>
