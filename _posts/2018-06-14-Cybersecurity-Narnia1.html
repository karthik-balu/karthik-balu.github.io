<p>
  Just like you enter commands like ls,cd into the terminal, you can store data in terminal. How? Through Terminal variables/ shell variables/ Environmental variables.
  So a program calling an Environmental variable or depending on such variables is susceptible to exploitation as these variables' values can be changed to malicious shellcode and exported.
  <br>
  So what is a shell code?<br>
  A shell code is special set of characters representing commands that run those commands when the compiler compiles it.
  So when the compiler prints or executes, a command is run, instead of just reading the data.
  <br>
  <a href="www.shell-storm.org"><b>Shell-storm.org</b></a> is a great source for shellcodes.<br>

  So an exercise to exploit Environmental Variables now. Narnia Level 1 is all about this.
  ssh into narnia1 with the password obtained previously.
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    <code>
      ssh narnia1@narnia.labs.overthewire.org -p 2226
      Password: efeidiedae
      cd /narnia/
      cat narnia1.c
  </code>
  </pre>

  <ul class="list-unstyled bold-head">
    <li>Snap of /narnia/narnia1.c</li>
    <img src="/static/images/projects/p10/i1.png" class="image-center image-bigger" />
    <li>What is the vulnerability?</li>
    <p>
      The Environmental variable EGG is stored in ret variable using getenv() function and ret() is executed.
      <pre class="prettyprint">
        <code>
        ret=getenv("EGG");
        ret();
      </code>
      </pre>
      So a shell-code to open /bin/sh with narnia2 privileges would get us the password for narnia2.
    </p>
    <li>Exploitation Steps:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose and copy the shell-code to your clipboard. I used this one <b><a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-399.php">here</a></b></li>
      <li>Store the shell-code to EGG variable as a print command from python and export it</li>
      <li>Execute ./narnia1</li>
      <li>Shell prompt will pop up on execution. Check whose privileges you have with "whoami" command. Crack the password for Narnia Level 2 with "cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia2"</li>
      <img src="/static/images/projects/p10/i2.png" class="image-center image-biggest" />
    </ol>

    <p>
      <li>Behind the scenes explanation:</li>
      EGG env variable stores a shell command to print the malicious shell-code(a set of binary characters that execute something intentional). <br>
      This particular shellcode used here is a copy of last Narnia level (narnia0) C code,Here I set the group Id or the effective ID as the real ID of the process and call /bin/sh <br>
      When it is executed, you get the shell with elevated privileges of narnia2(Refer Narnia0 post <b> <a href="https://karthik-balu.github.io/projects/2018/05/23/Cybersecurity-Narnia0"> here</a></b> for owning user,owning groups of narnia files or do "ls -l" from /narnia)<br>
      With elevated privileges, you get the password of the next level with a simple cat command. Neat Hack as they say :)<br>
    </p>

    </ul>
