		As if in slow motion, a white line traces itself on the black velvety sky. Observers cross their fingers, wishing to the heavens, as the line slowly erases itself. Meteor showers are a sight to behold – nature’s firework display in the starry sky. So, here’s a list of meteor showers and rare celestial events that’ll satiate those astronomer-nerves in you.

		<li>Quadrantid Shower<br></li>

		The first meteor shower of the year peaks between midnight and dawn on January 4th, producing 50-100 showers per hour on an average. It is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and peaks at around 14:00 hrs UTC. The waning crescent moon would set by midnight, leaving the viewers the dark skies to themselves to watch out for. It radiates from the Bootes constellation.

		<li>Lyrids Shower<br></li>

		The Lyrids are average showers producing 10-20 meteorites per hour during its peak, which is predicted at 12:00 hrs UTC on the 23rd of April. It is set to happen during the waning crescent moon and is best viewed in the Northern hemisphere. It radiates from the constellation Lyra.

	<p>
		<li>Eta Aquarids<br></li>

		<span class="tinycaption">Eta Aquarid over Mount Bromo, Indonesia- Justin Ng - 2013</span>
		An above-average shower, Eta Aquarids produces 40-80 meteorites an hour during late April and early May. It is predicted to peak at 02:00hrs UTC on May 6th. Most of its activity is seen in the Southern Hemisphere. The waxing moon will block out many of the fainter meteorites this year. However, flashy and long displays from these meteor showers make the wait to see them worth it. It radiates from the constellation Aquarius.

		<li>Delta Aquarids<br></li>

		<span class="tinycaption">Delta Aquarids over Wyoming – David S.Brown - 2014</span>
		Delta Aquarids is an average shower producing 15-25 displays per hour between July and August. It is set to reach its zenith on the 30th July in 2017. Its activity is best observed in the Southern Hemisphere. The new moon on the 23rd July makes conditions great for viewing as the moon shall set by midnight. It radiates from the constellation Aquarius too.

		<li>Perseids<br></li>

		<span class="tinycaption">Perseid Shower over Californian skies – Jason Miller - 2016</span>
		The Perseids are above-average showers, which produce between 60-150 streaks. They are set to peak on August 12th. However, the full moon occurring on the August 7th may play a part in spoiling the display. It radiates from the constellation Perseus.

		<li>Total Solar Eclipse<br></li>
		<img src="/static/images/a1i6.png" class="center" />
		<span class="tinycaption">How a Total Solar Eclipse looks</span>
		A Total Solar Eclipse happens when the sun is completely blocked by the moon making only the outer atmosphere of the sun visible. This once-in-a-lifetime event is sent to happen within North American subcontinent exclusively in 2017 on the 21st of August.<br>

		The best spot to view it in a natural environment would be the land between Lake Recreational Areas between Kentucky and Barkley lakes in West Kentucky and Tennessee. The totality is expected to last 2 minutes 40 seconds in the area. Make sure you reach there by 1pm and have your solar filter/ solar glasses ready!

		<li>Draconids<br></li>

		<span class="tinycaption">Image Captured by Jesper Grønne in Denmark - 2011</span>
		The sleeping Dragon Draco produces a handful of fireballs every year. This year Draconids are expected to peak on the 8th October, just 3 days after the full moon. This will visually trouble viewing the showers, which is predominantly visible in the Northern Hemisphere.

		<li>Orionids<br></li>
		<img src="/static/images/a1i10.png" class="center" />
		<span class="tinycaption">Orionids Captured in Montana by John Ashley - 2015</span>
		The Hunter’s pebbles, Orionids exhibit a maximum of 10-20 meteorites per hour. It peaks on the 21st of October. This is immediately after the New Moon on October 19th and therefore, viewers can expect clear skies to see these wonders. They radiate from the club of the Hunter Constellation, Orion.

		<li>Leonids<br></li>
		<img src="/static/images/a1i11.png" class="center" />
		<span class="tinycaption">Leonids captured by Aaron Robinson at Idaho- 2015</span>
		Leonids produce a show of around 10-20 meteorites per hour. They peak on the 17th of November at around 16:30hrs UTC. Leonid Maximum coincides with the New Moon on the 18th November. Leonids originate in the Lion Constellation Leo.

		<li>The Supermoon<br></li>
		<img src="/static/images/a1i12.png" class="center" />
		<span class="tinycaption">First Supermoon of 2015 – the Gaurdian</span>
		The only Supermoon of 2017 occurs on December 3. The Full Moon will be on the other side of the Earth as the Sun and the face of the moon will be illuminated. The Moon will be at its closest positon to the Earth and will look larger and brighter than usual. It’ll cause higher tides than usual too.
	</p>
	<p>
		<li>Geminids<br></li>
		<img src="/static/images/a1i13.png" class="center" />
		<span class="tinycaption">Geminids captured by NASA - 2015</span>
		The ever-reliable Geminids fall out at their maximum of 100-140 meteorites per hour on the 14th of December at 06:30hrs UTC. The New moon falls on the 18th of December making the waning crescent moon no match for the bright Geminids. The Geminids originate in the Twins Constellation Gemini.
