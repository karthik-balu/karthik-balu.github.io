<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b>11th January:</b> It was 12 in the afternoon when I  hurriedly submitted my English Sem paper and hurried home. I still  hadn’t begun packing for the impending trip. So, by 4.10pm all bags  packed and goodbyes said, I caught some buses and ended up at CMBT at  6pm to witness a colossal crowd and only reserved buses. Siva arrived  soon afterward and we thought we’d board a bus to Dindugul and then  change to Cumbum(pronounced Kam-bam) – our destination. Luck had it for  us and a unreserved bus to Cumbum appeared outta nowhere. We boarded it  quickly and after exchanging stories and plans fell asleep.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bats going batty!!!" class="photo_img img" src="https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/l/t1.0-9/s180x540/1533761_751408328220214_1385265269_n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Bats going batty!!!" /></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Bat Mania</td></tr></tbody></table><b>12th January:</b> We reached Cumbum early, around 6 am(not sure). A friend of Siva was  trekking with some of his friends near Cumbum and he joined us soon. We  boarded his hired car and went along with him and his pals to  Panniyapuram – birth place to the legendary Illayaraja, passing several  towns, one of which was Kombai, popular of Kombai dogs and cardamom tea.  Our destination was a farm at Meenakshipuram near Panniyapuram. This  particular farm reared racing bulls. The farm’s lord replied that he did  it for name and fame. He let open the enclosure and sent his bulls to  graze(with his men to keep watch,ofcourse). A calf trotted around before  it was sent back to the enclosure. After some knowledge munching on  branding of a bull, the difference between fighting bulls and racing  bulls, it was time to munch on the delicious breakfast Siva’s friend  provided. After the meal, we went on in the car, uphill Agamalai and  visited Kannakarai. Enroute, we stopped at a tree infested with bats!  Sensing our presence, the bats began flying to another tree nearby and  the sky was soon filled with flapping wings.   After some photos we went on to Kannakarai, which was strewn with  broken glass in some parts, thanks to beer bottles being brought there  by the locals. After some time relishing the cool waters and munching  our lunch, we went to Periyakulam, visiting Sothupaarai dam on the way.  We parted ways with Siva’s friend Mr. Sridhar at Periyakulam. Another of  Siva’s friends, Ranjith anna , joined us for the trekking days to come.  We went from Periyakulam to Bodi and got our dinners parcelled and had  an auto ride to Kurangani, our base for the trek. It was 8pm when we  started up. After some steep climbing,wandering and dining in front of  Sambalaaru, we reached Central Station. It was 11.30pm and we planned to  camp for the night. We stayed at Ranjith anna’s friend’s place who was  kind enough to accommodate us. We dozed soon enough.<br /><br /><b>13th January:</b><br />It  was around 5.30am in the morn when I woke up to the beep-beep of my  alarm and the thuds of the roof to the cold winds outside. We got up and  packed our stuff and proceeded uphill at 6am after bidding our goodbye  and expressing our thanks to our host. We wandered a bit from the trail  and soon corrected ourselves after a fashion. We saw sun’s rays glisten  on mountain rocks making them look all fiery. After a rush, we reached  Top Station at 8.30 am and went on to the view point some 200metres  ahead. Our destinations- Kolugumalai and Meesapulimalai were shrouded in  mist. After some photo-clicks, some rest and breakfast, we went to the  bus-stop. After some patient waiting, we got into a jeep to Munaar,  Kerala. We reached Munaar after an hour and I slept mostly. We boarded a  bus to Suriyanelli from where we planned to go to Kolugumalai on a  jeep. It was around 11 am. The jeep which we were bargaining with rushed  off without notice and we boarded another jeep after getting chocolates  and bread for lunch. We got up Kolugumalai and got off 1.5kms before  the stop-point witnessing the tea planting and the Tamil Nadu-Kerala  border. We got off to a wrong start to Meesapulimala and soon reached a  dead-end. After a phone-call and some walking, we got into the right  path and started trekking up. Enroute, we doubted if we could complete  the trek on time and get back to Kurangani, where the last bus was  scheduled to leave at 6. So, we put off Meesapulimala and went back on  our jeep-route, walking all the way to the tea estate. After drinking  some really enchanting tea, I couldn’t resist getting another cup. The  tea was better than rumours! We left after some enquires as to which  path to take to Kurangani. We left the world’s highest organic tea  estate at around 2 pm.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span class="photo photo_center" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Tea-hee ;)" class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t1.0-9/s180x540/1535616_751408934886820_1988279238_n.jpg" title="Tea-hee ;)" /><span class="caption"> </span></span></div><br />We  trudged along the path spiralling downwards in its descent, at times  vanishing in the thick vegetation. I had some falls at some slippery  places. &nbsp;I was sorely out of form and was lagging behind at every point.  We were some 200 metres(altitude not the distance) &nbsp;away and the time  was around 5.40pm. I began running. I ran where I could and when I  couldn’t I walked panting. Siva ran ahead of me and stopped only when,  in anti-climax, a dog started barking at him! Ranjith anna ran ahead to  shoo away the dog and Siva and Ranjith anna ran to the bus which had  just arrived then. I ran behind and we got into the bus, happy at having  completed a circle round a small part of the western ghats. It was 6.02  pm.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to stay at a place near  Bodi-mettu. It was a coffee estate from which we had to trek for some 2  hours if we wanted to reach Bodi-mettu. We reached the place at around  8pm and after asking permission to stay, we ate dinner offered by the  gracious people there. We slept like logs.<br /><br /><b>14th January and 15th January:</b><br />I  woke up to find Siva folding up his sheets. I groggily asked him what  the time was. He didn’t reply clearly and said that he wanted to see the  sun-rise. I got up soon enough and joined him towards east. The estate  gave an awesome view of Bodi-town to the east. And the sun rose in all  its glory, as a fiery ball from the mist below. It was some amazing  feeling watching that.<br /><span class="photo "><img alt="The glorious sun rise...!! :) :)" class="photo_img img" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/1506546_751408444886869_1953639554_n.jpg?oh=4e30a2fb014a9b7a77385f04c0aa33a0&amp;oe=546F5C62&amp;__gda__=1417163563_81ba676ac77e55ac88a49af8a7070ca9" title="The glorious sun rise...!! :) :)" /><span class="caption">The glorious sun rise...!! :) :)</span></span><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s180x540/1017413_751408871553493_873933747_n.jpg?oh=405f8652ad8d9b8a750d255fba667305&amp;oe=545F9ED4&amp;__gda__=1416653910_c0563cf96795fbe5b42d67079794999e" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="LEECH!

(FYI: Leeches dont suck blood from palm of the hand)</span></span></i></td></tr></tbody></table>Soon,  the people there began preparations for pongal in the regular  Tamil-Nadu way! The pongal boiled up and got ready soon. We had our  baths and had a small prayer before eating the delicious dishes offered.  We decided to trek to Bodi-mettu at 11am. With stomachs full and hearts  filled with gratitude, we proceeded to Bodi-mettu. Our path wasn’t  clear at many places, not being trodden for years. In addition there  were leeches!<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s180x540/1521371_751408758220171_261944134_n.jpg?oh=066cd370bec0ca419ea2e35d1ba82d15&amp;oe=547B7513" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Tirumalai Nayak Palace.." border="0" class="photo_img img" src="https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/s180x540/1521371_751408758220171_261944134_n.jpg?oh=066cd370bec0ca419ea2e35d1ba82d15&amp;oe=547B7513" title="Tirumalai Nayak Palace.." /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Thirumalai Nayak Palace</td></tr></tbody></table>The  squirmy things got Siva and Ranjith anna in the legs while I lagged  behind stamping my shoes. We reached Kalliparai which was part of  Kerala! After a short walk we reached Bodhi-mettu. We boarded a bus to  Theni at around 3pm. At theni, Ranjith anna parted ways with us and  proceeded to Periyakulam and we went on our way to Madurai, reaching  Mattuthavani bus-stop at 5pm. We were hungry and it was pongal and we  had some money remaining. We went to Anjappar and ate to our heart’s  fill. We then went to Thirumalai Nayak palace. Enroute, we found out the  famous Jiggirthanda shop where we drank the famed drink gluttonously.  We got two tickets to the Sound and Light show at the Palace to kill  time. &nbsp;The  show from 8 to 8.50pm was illuminating but I missed most of it sleeping  or commenting on it. We got into a share-auto to Maatuthavani, reaching  it at 9.30pm.<br /><br />We got good seats at a good bus and reached  Tambaram at around 5am on 15th Jan where I parted ways with Siva. As I  trudged homewards for more of sleep, in the gloomy darkness and the  smoke of Chennai, all I could think of was the mountain air and the  fiery sun-ball in the mists of the Bodhi coffee estate.</div>
