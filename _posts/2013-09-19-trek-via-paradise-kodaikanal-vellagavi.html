It was the 7th September, Saturday and I was at Saranathan College of  Engineering attending a wonderful 2 day symposium. After some nice work  for the brain, it was time my limbs got some exercise. Siva was the  organiser as always and it was planned that Siva would meet up with me  at Trichy Bus stand at some time after midnight. It was 4pm. I left the  symposium with happy memories and proceeded to find accommodation till  midnight. Arunachalan who sat out this trek coz he wanted to be at his  home town for Ganesh chaturthi, suggested a place and thus began my  walks along Trichy’s streets. I finally found the place but as luck  would have it, they refused to accommodate me saying Aruna needed to be  with me then for me to stay there. Aruna didn’t know that. I had gone to  that particular place for its lower fares, considering I would only  stay for some 6 hours. Now that I had nowhere to stay, I called up Siva  who was then boarding a bus from CMBT to Trichy and he came up with the  idea that I could roam Srirangam or Malaikottai till he reaches Trichy. I  chose Srirangam. After an hour’s journey, I reached the famed temple  that was teeming with devotees. I was in no mood to walk in that crowd  to get a glimpse of the main deity. So, after visiting deities that were  less crowded, I ended up resting by a pillar near the food counter and  was debating whether or not to get food there. Just then, a familiar  face popped up in front of me and gave me a nice surprise! It’s always a  great feeling to see old school buddies, especially people whose lunch  you seized ;) It was Shabhari and he was staying with relatives in the  vicinity. After a nice chat with him and a soda, I bade him goodbye. I  had a message from Siva suggesting I go to a net café that was open. I  liked the idea and went over to a net café outside the temple and had a  nice chat with a couple of college-mates until the owner came over and  told me it was closing hours. It was 9.30pm. After leaving the browsing  centre, I went to a roadside mess, very hungry and had awesome,hot dosas  and idlis. After some more loitering in Srirangam, I boarded a bus to  Trichy Central bus stand. It was 11pm. Thus began my several hours wait  for Siva’s arrival. Siva’s bus was delayed due to traffic problems and  finally arrived at 3.30 am. I had completely gone around the bus stand  some 20-30 times, took some midnight self-shots and had no sleep. After  his arrival, we wasted no time and boarded a bus to Dindugul and as no  seats were available, it was a standing and sleep-as-u-stand journey.  The bus stopped a lot due to residents enroute Dindugul stopping the bus  to load their farm produce on the top etc., After an hour’s travel, we  reached Dindugul. On finding no buses to kodaikanal there, we proceeded  to Vatlagundu or Batlagundu as it’s called officially. Another hour went  by - this time we sat on the gear box up front. On reaching Vatlagundu,  it was tea and bajji time. A bus to kodaikanal came along and another  sit-on-the-gearbox journey followed. I slept through most of the journey  and when I was awake, magnificent landscape laid itself bare in front  of me. Rat-tail falls and various holidays resorts were some stuff I  remember seeing during the journey. It was 11am when we reached the  kodaikanal bus stop. The bus to Vattakanal,our trek’s base, had already  left and we had no choice but to take a car to that place. The driver,  Gabriel, wanted to profit a lot and made sure we had his mobile number  and insisted we call him up next time we came to kodaikanal. We reached  Vattakanal soon enough and started walking down to Dolphin’s nose area.  We had a nice hot bread omelette. Dolphin’s nose is a jutting rocky area  shaped like the nose of Dolphin and it stands some 6600 feet above  ground level. After some snaps there, we took a diversion from the path  traversed by tourists and took one that goes to the Vellagavi. Guided by  electric poles and horse hooves, we trekked downhill. The mist ahead  added a splash of mystery over the enchanting land full of wonderful,  totally-WOW scenery. We had some really tasty water from a geyser there.  It was really paradisiac. We reached the fair village of Vellagavi at  1pm, an hour and half’s trek. Vellagavi has a lot of temples and the  residents consider the land holy ground. There is a signboard asking  visitors to the land to remove their footwear. Siva wasn’t sure if we  could carry the shoes too. I went in first to confirm. A lady there was  filling up her buckets with water. After introduction and enquiry, she  said it’s ok to carry shoes and told us to drop by her place for coffee!  So packing our shoes into a bag, we proceeded to Vellagavi. She even  asked us to stay for lunch. I guess the people of Vellagavi define  hospitality. After 30 minutes at Vellagavi, we started our trek downhill  to Kumbakarai. It was looking like it was going to rain and I removed  my socks, put on my shoes and we started our run. It started raining a  lot and we put on our raincoats. We met up with a man and a dog halfway.  Siva was calling out to the man to restrain the barking dog and didn’t  want to go ahead until he was sure the dog was harmless! The man told us  we were 45 mins away and advised us to take left wherever a path  branches out and sat there smoking. We went on. I felt uneasy walking  just then and pulled out my shoes to find out that my shoes had a bit of  sand and little stones and those pesky little nitwits had torn my feet.  I slowed down the trek considerably, limping mostly, running where I  could, to catch up. We stopped at a stream to get some water and snaps  and I had a nice slip there and my jeans got wet. When the odds are bad,  brave the odds and they’ll turn good. I kept going, wanting to finish  the trek and we met two people going down and they said the stream to  Kumbakarai was flooding coz of rain and they took us through another  path. After lots of catching up, bison-sighting and panting, we finally  emerged out of the trek to place where these men had parked their bikes.  It was some minutes past 3.30pm. What smiles we had on our faces!

An  hour and half’s trek downhill was completed in 2 hours with injured  feet B-) The guys were workers from Periyakulam which was our  destination and offered us a lift. Sadly one of the bikes didn’t start  up, thanks to the rains that had now stopped. So it was triples on one  bike with the other bike being towed along with a towel held by Siva! :D  It was semma amazing and we reached periyakulam soon and had hot coffee  there before going to the bus stop. I was totally limping now and we  boarded a bus to Madurai from there. We reached Madurai at around 6pm  and went to a place to change out of our dripping wet clothes. We then  got a bus to maatuthavani bus stop. We ate at a nearby hotel and went  bus-hunting. We finally got seats in a bus and set off to Chennai at  around 9.15pm. I slept like a log.I bade goodbye to Siva at tambaram at  4am in the morn and reached home soon, filled with memories of limping  in the rain at Vellagavi! :D </p></div>
